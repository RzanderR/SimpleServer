Simple python web servers implemented using Flask

Prereqs: flask
On replit, you can just run the program and it will install flask (the program will fail when run since you didn't do the steps below, but it will at least install flask).
Or alternatively pip install or conda install.

To try it:
1. Start the server: from terminal, run: flask --app flask_server run
2. Run the client: main.py (make sure PORT=5000)

Look in flask_server.py for more information
